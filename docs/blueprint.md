- The application will use black and white as main colors.
- Accent color: Light green (#90EE90) for buttons and interactive elements to subtly highlight them.

## Original User Request:
A simple web app, minimalist, typewriter-like font, white background, has an apple simple icon in the middle, apple the fruit, not the product, and it has a counter button down to add or remove the number of apples you want to add to the page. the only other element in the web page is a button that says: "send apples to a friend", which creates a message that the user can copy that says "Hola tu, here are {x} apples, just because." Yes, I know it's a silly app, but I want to do it anyways. You can close the message and start again. It has a text, small, below, that says "by danielazamorah, creator @ morabalbs"
